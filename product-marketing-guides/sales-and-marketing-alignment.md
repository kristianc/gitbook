# Sales and Marketing Alignment

Alignment between Marketing and Sales is potentially the largest opportunity for improving business performance today. When marketing and sales teams unite around a single revenue cycle, they dramatically improve marketing ROI, sales productivity, and, most importantly, top-line growth.

Tried and true practices for improving Sales and Marketing alignment include:

* Meeting regularly with sales teams
* Co-ordinating content creation and collateral
* Listen in on sales calls
* Facilitate sales training if required
* Using technology to organize sales resources in a single place
* Get to know each other

Sales and marketing alignment is not a one-and-done process, and never will be. Marketing has to earn its seat at the table by demonstrating value, and the ability to drive positive outcomes.
