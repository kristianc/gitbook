# Do You Need Product Marketing Help?

You may be lucky and not need support with Product Marketing. If all your products are selling quickly and your only feedback is kind notes from happy customers, you likely have a successful product marketing strategy. 

However, these covert signs might indicate that you need help:

* Decisions about audience, features, and pricing are made by people who don’t have the data or understand the market.
* Products are developed and put into the market without a launch plan or a budget.
* Sales staff have to create their own collateral and spec sheets.
* Your company doesn’t have relevant data about its customers, market share, and sales.
* The role of marketing is simply to write web copy or social media messages or design brochures.
* Don’t hire product marketing professionals simply to help your overworked product development team get the product finished. The jobs, while related, are not the same.
* Product marketing will not make the product faster. It will make the product better, because they understand what your audience needs.
