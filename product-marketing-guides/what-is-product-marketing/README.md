# What is Product Marketing?

{% hint style="info" %}
The role of a product marketer is to **define the positioning and messaging of products, and to plan and execute product releases and launches**.

The key function of product marketing is connecting your consumers to your products. Not only does product marketing require deep knowledge of your customers, but you must also understand your product and how to position it in a crowded marketplace. As the product marketer, you are responsible for the success of your product. Key deliverables include:

* A [clear market position](https://wiki.kristiancarter.com/creating-a-market-requirements-document) that distinguishes you from the competition
* Product pricing and packaging
* A marketing and promotion plan to help your sales channels succeed
* Analysis of customer response and keeping the product relevant

The difference between Product Marketing and other functions is that it is only the product marketer who is responsible for focusing on the positioning of the product by defining itself in the market and separating itself from the competition. In addition, it is the PMM who works closely with PMs and technical teams and to take technical and often detailed product information and turn it into marketing material.
