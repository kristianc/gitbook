# Creating Defensible Product Positioning

The basic idea of positioning is that your product occupies a place in the mind of the people in your target market. You are defined by their perceptions of you.

Product Positioning should contain the following:

* **Vision Statement** - a company's road map, indicating what the company wants to become by setting a defined direction for the company's growth.
* **Positioning Statement** - an expression of how a given product, service or brand fills a particular consumer need in a way that its competitors don't.
* **Value Propositions** - a promise of value to be delivered, communicated, and acknowledged. It is also a belief from the customer about how value will be delivered, experienced and acquired. This might be for instance "Efficiency" or "Increased Sales"
* **Key Messages** -  the core messages you want your target audience to hear and remember. They create meaning and headline the issues you want to discuss.
* **Proof Points** -   if you make a claim, you must support it with solid evidence. Without **proof**, you run the risk of sounding hollow or boastful. In marketing-speak, a **proof** point is an example that offers irrefutable evidence of the quality, importance or uniqueness of something.

Your positioning statement should contain:

* First, describing a position almost always includes a _superlative_ of some kind.  In this case, the superlative is "most popular", but I could have said "number one".  Often people can remember only the first and best thing in a category.  Being number 6 in your market segment is probably not a position at all.
* Second, a position will describe what _label_ the market places on your product.  In this case, the label is "operating system", which fits just fine.  If there is no label which fits your product, you have a big problem.  If the market cannot compare your product to something else, then you don't have a position.
* Third, the position will have _qualifiers_ which define exactly what group of people have this perspective of a product.  In our example, the market segment is "for desktop PCs".  This position doesn't say anything about operating systems for enterprise servers or mobile phones.
* Fourth, the position will have _proof points_ which define why the user should believe. In our example, Windows has a market share of generally above 75% in most markets.
