# Product Marketing Strategy - A Primer

A Product Marketing strategy is the plan of an organization, utilizing their inside and outside resources, to deliver their unique value proposition to customers and achieve competitive advantage.

My process for creating a Product Marketing strategy is to:

* Create a robust MRD
* Establish defensible product positioning
* Define the collateral that needs to be created
* Define a plan for bringing that collateral to market
