# Collateral Journey

Everyone has a different approach to deciding which collateral needs to be created as part of the Buyer Journey.

My approach has always been to work with the CCO or a senior stakeholder and get them to talk me through the process of a sales deal. 

How does the deal typically start? What is required for first and second meetings? Do they usually ask for technical or non-technical documents? These are all important questions to be asking.

Typical pieces of collateral that you might want to think about creating are:

* Sales Deck
* FAQs \(internal and external\)
* Product Brochure 
* Recording of Product Demo
* Case Studies
* White Label Technical Paper
* API Docs
* Standard Set of Reports
* Software Specification
* Product Demo

For enablement purposes, you might also consider creating competitive battlecards or sales playbooks.
