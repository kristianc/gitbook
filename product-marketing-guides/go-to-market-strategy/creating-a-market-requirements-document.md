A Market Requirements Document should be **led by marketing**, but should receive input from product, commercial and engineering.

Typically, a Market Requirements Document contains:

* Strategy and Overview
  * Goals and Objectives
  * Strategic Road Map
  * Customer Categories \(User Profiles\)
  * Competitive Strengths and Weaknesses
  * External Positioning
* Business Model
  * Value Proposition
  * Market Segment
  * Value Chain Structure
  * Cost Structure
  * Position within the Value Network
