# The Art of Product Marketing

This is my personal wiki where I share information about Product Marketing and Product Management in the form of an [online Gitbook](http://gitbook.com/).

I set this site up because of what I understood to be a lack of concise Product Marketing information online.

This is primarily intended for a B2B Marketing audience, though many of the principles can also apply to consumer. It can be applied to both enterprise sales and low-touch SaaS solutions.

This wiki shares principles and frameworks to help you do better product marketing.

## Using the wiki well

You can quickly search the contents of this wiki above or you can explore the tree view to the left.
